	abstract = {Introduction
	Taxi drivers could be at risk regarding their respiratory health due to their constant exposure to traffic related air pollutants (TRAP) inside their vehicles. Therefore, we aimed to review pollutants exposure inside taxi vehicles and its determinants as well as its acute adverse respiratory effects.
	Methods
	The literature search was done in Pubmed and in Embase. For additional resources we searched manually articles from the reference lists of the selected papers and from Google Scholar. We included only studies in French or in English language meeting the following eligibility criteria: design: observational and quasi-experimental; study population: taxi drivers or taxi commuters, outcome: pollutants levels in taxicabs and/or acute adverse respiratory effects. Data was extracted using tabulation according to the type of the study (exposure or epidemiological).
	Results
	Out of 1753 articles, 21 studies were included. Exposure studies underlined that TRAP concentrations inside taxicabs were higher than their urban background levels and even exceeded those recorded in buses, in trains and when commuting by active transport modes. Overall, their concentrations varied widely between studies depending on the characteristics of the urban environment and the vehicle fleet of each location. Meteorological parameters and ventilation settings appeared to influence pollutants concentrations inside each vehicle. Otherwise, deficiency in epidemiological studies and inconsistencies in their findings restrain our ability to determine the association between acute respiratory effects and exposure to TRAP inside taxicabs.
	Conclusion
	Although studies are heterogeneous, results have shown a high but variable occupational exposure of taxi drivers to TRAP inside their vehicles. However, future researches are required to study short respiratory impact of taxi drivers' exposure to TRAP inside their vehicles.}

	ABSTRACT = {Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) was monitored using a mobile sensor network on 125 urban taxis in Shanghai (November 2019/December 2020), which provide real-time patterns of air pollution at high spatial resolution. Each device determined concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and PM2.5, which characterised spatial and temporal patterns of on-road pollutants. A total of 80% road coverage (motorways, trunk, primary, and secondary roads) required 80&ndash;100 taxis, but only 25 on trunk roads. Higher CO concentrations were observed in the urban centre, NO2 higher in motorway concentrations, and PM2.5 lower in the west away from the city centre. During the COVID-19 lockdown, concentrations of CO, NO2, and PM2.5 in Shanghai decreased by 32, 31 and 41%, compared with the previous period. Local contribution related to traffic emissions changed slightly before and after COVID-19 restrictions, while changing background contributions relate to seasonal variation. Mobile networks are a real-time tool for air quality monitoring, with high spatial resolution (~200 m) and robust against the loss of individual devices.},

	abstract = { Congested traffic corridors in dense urban areas are key contributors to the degradation of urban air quality. While waiting at bus stops, transit patrons may be exposed to greater amounts of vehicle-based pollution, including particulate matter (PM), because of their proximity to the roadway. Current guidelines for the location and the design of bus stops do not take into account air quality or exposure considerations. This study compared the exposure of transit riders waiting at three-sided bus stop shelters that either faced the roadway traffic or faced away from the roadway traffic. Shelters were instrumented with air quality monitoring equipment, sonic anemometers, and vehicle counters. Data were collected for 2 days at three shelters during both the morning and the afternoon peak periods. Bus shelter orientation was found to significantly affect concentration of four sizes of PM: ultrafine particles, PM1, PM2.5, and PM10. Shelters with an opening oriented toward the roadway were consistently observed to have higher concentrations inside the shelter than outside the shelter. In contrast, shelters oriented away from the roadway were observed to have lower concentrations inside the shelter than outside the shelter. The differences in PM concentration were statistically significant across all four sizes of particulate matter studied. Traffic flow was shown to have a significant relationship with all sizes of particulate concentration levels inside bus shelters. Microscale anemometer measurements were made next to bus shelters. Both wind speed and direction were shown to affect particulate concentrations differently, depending on shelter orientation.

	abstract = {Vehicle interior air quality (VIAQ) was investigated inside 14 diesel/non-diesel taxi pairs operating simultaneously and under normal working conditions over six weekday hours (10.00–16.00) in the city of Barcelona, Spain. Parameters measured included PM10 mass and inorganic chemistry, ultrafine particle number (N) and size, lung surface deposited area (LDSA), black carbon (BC), CO2, CO, and a range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Most taxi drivers elected to drive with windows open, thus keeping levels of CO2 and internally-generated VOCs low but exposing them to high levels of traffic-related air pollutants entering from outside and confirming that air exchange rates are the dominant influence on VIAQ. Median values of N and LDSA (both sensitive markers of VIAQ fluctuations and likely health effects) were reduced to around 104 #/cm3 and < 20 µm2/cm3 respectively under closed conditions, but more than doubled with windows open and sometimes approached 105 #/cm3 and 240 µm2/cm3. In exceptional traffic conditions, transient pollution peaks caused by outside infiltration exceeded N = 106 #/cm3 and LDSA= 1000 µm2/cm3. Indications of self-pollution were implicated by higher BC and CO levels, and larger UFP sizes, measured inside diesel taxis as compared to their non-diesel pair, and the highest concentrations of CO (>2 ppm) were commonly associated with older, high-km diesel taxis. Median PM10 concentrations (67 µg/m3) were treble those of urban background, mainly due to increased levels of organic and elemental carbon, with source apportionment calculations identifying the main pollutants as vehicle exhaust and non-exhaust particles. Enhancements in PM10 concentrations of Cr, Cu, Sn, Sb, and a “High Field Strength Element” zircon-related group characterised by Zr, Hf, Nb, Y and U, are attributed mainly to the presence of brake-derived PM. Volatile organic compounds display a mixture which reflects the complexity of traffic-related organic carbon emissions infiltrating the taxi interior, with 2-methylbutane and n-pentane being the most abundant VOCs, followed by toluene, m-xylene, o-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, ethylbenzene, p-xylene, benzene, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. Internally sourced VOCs included high monoterpene concentrations from an air freshener, and interior off-gassing may explain why the youngest taxi registered the highest content of alkanes and aromatic compounds. Carbon dioxide concentrations quickly climbed to undesirable levels (>2500 ppm) under closed ventilation conditions and could stay high for much of the working day. Taxi drivers face daily occupational exposure to traffic-related air pollutants and would benefit from a greater awareness of VIAQ issues, notably the use of ventilation, to encourage them to minimise possible health effects caused by their working environment.

	abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that environmentally relevant elevations in CO2 (<5,000 ppm) may pose direct risks for human health. Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations could make adverse exposures more frequent and prolonged through increases in indoor air concentrations and increased time spent indoors. We review preliminary evidence concerning the potential health risks of chronic exposure to environmentally relevant elevations in ambient CO2, including inflammation, reductions in higher-level cognitive abilities, bone demineralization, kidney calcification, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. This early evidence indicates potential health risks at CO2 exposures as low as 1,000 ppm—a threshold that is already exceeded in many indoor environments with increased room occupancy and reduced building ventilation rates, and equivalent to some estimates for urban outdoor air concentrations before 2100. Continuous exposure to increased atmospheric CO2 could be an overlooked stressor of the modern and/or future environment. Further research is needed to quantify the major sources of CO2 exposure, to identify mitigation strategies to avoid adverse health effects and protect vulnerable populations, and to fully understand the potential health effects of chronic or intermittent exposure to indoor air with higher CO2 concentrations.}

A systematic review of various sensors and systems for AQ management may strengthen our understanding of the monitoring and management of AQ. Thus, the current review presents details on sensors/systems available for AQ assessment, monitoring, and management. First, we had gone through the published literature based on special keywords including AQM, Particulate Matter (PM), Carbon Mono-oxide (CO), Sulfur di-Oxide (SO2), and Nitrogen di-Oxide (NO2) among others, and identified the current scenario of research in AQ management. We discussed various sensors/systems available for the AQ management based on self-conceptualised five major categories including, ground-based AQS (wet chemistry) systems, ground-based digital sensors systems, aerial sensors systems, satellite-based sensors systems, and integrated systems. The prospects in the field of AQ assessment and management (AQA&M) were then discussed in detail. We concluded that the AQA&M can be better achieved by coupling new technologies like ground-based smart sensors, satellite remote sensing sensors, Geospatial technologies, and computational technologies like machine learning, Artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things (IoT). The current work may lead to a junction of information for connecting these sensors/systems, which is expected to be beneficial in future AQ research and management.}

	abstract = {Environmental monitoring is one of the most important applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which usually requires a lifetime of several months, or even years. However, the inherent restriction of energy carried within the battery of sensor nodes brings an extreme difficulty to obtain a satisfactory network lifetime, which becomes a bottleneck in scale of such applications in WSNs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework with dedicated combination of data prediction, compression, and recovery to simultaneously achieve accuracy and efficiency of the data processing in clustered WSNs. The main aim of the framework is to reduce the communication cost while guaranteeing the data processing and data prediction accuracy. In this framework, data prediction is achieved by implementing the Least Mean Square (LMS) dual prediction algorithm with optimal step size by minimizing the mean-square derivation (MSD), in a way that the cluster heads (CHs) can obtain a good approximation of the real data from the sensor nodes. On this basis, a centralized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique is utilized to perform the compression and recovery for the predicted data on the CHs and the sink, separately in order to save the communication cost and to eliminate the spatial redundancy of the sensed data about environment. All errors generated in these processes are finally evaluated theoretically, which come out to be controllable. Based on the theoretical analysis, we design a number of algorithms for implementation. Simulation results by using the real world data demonstrate that our framework provides a cost-effective solution to such as environmental monitoring applications in cluster based WSNs.}
