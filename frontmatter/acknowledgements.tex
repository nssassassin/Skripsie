%I would like to thank my dog, Muffin. I also would like to thank the inventor of the incubator; without him/her, I would not be here. Finally, I would like to thank Dr Herman Kamper for this amazing report template.

I would like to thank my supervisor Thinus Booysen for giving me this skripsie topic and for his enthusiasm in his work. I would also like to thank my friend and\\ co-(soon-to-be)-engineer Phillip, for keeping me sane for most of my degree.
