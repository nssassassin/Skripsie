\subsection{Interface}
The ESP32-S2 is capable of multiple STA and AP modes, including simultaneous broadcasting over ESP-NOW and WiFi. This is needed to be able to have the 2 ESP boards communicate and the base station be able to send the data to a database.

\subsection{UART}

\subsection{i2c}
Both the Sensirion and Senseair sensors make use of the i2c bus to communicate. 
\subsection{ESP-NOW}

\subsection{SD - interface}
The SD card interface was done using SPI. The module was hard soldered to a micro SD to SD card adaptor. These pins were then soldered to the ESP32's SPI and 3.3V pins.
The FS, SD and SPI libraries from Espresiff were used to interface with the already formatted micro SD card.
