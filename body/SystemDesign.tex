\section{Hardware Overview}
\subsection{Microcontroller}
An essential part of this project is the microcontroller, since it contains and controls many of the aspects needed for the project to work.
Choosing a microcontroller comes down to it's features. For this project the features considered were:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Speed
	\item Communication capabilities
	\item Expandability / IO
	\item Storage
	\item Compatibility
	\item Power draw
	\item Size
	\item Cost
\end{itemize}

A few common microcontroller boards available at the time of writing are compared in the table below:

\subsection{$\mathrm{CO_2}$}
% why was it chosen
\subsection{PM, $\mathrm{NO_x}$, VOC}

\section{Metrics}
%Does the sensor actually work...
%Does it work as wanted
