\section{Air Quality Monitoring}
For this project it is necessary to monitor the air quality and how that pertains to health conditions and what causes the rise in these prarameters.
\subsection{Choosing Monitoring Parameters}
For monitoring it is important to choose parameters relevant to the topic at hand, in this case emissions from taxis, or for the relevance of finding data on the former, minibuses. It is found that minibus taxis produce the following gases\cite{gasfromvehicles} :

\begin{itemize}
	\item Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$)
	\item Methane ($CH_4$)
	\item Nitrous Oxides ($NO_x$)
	\item Air Conditioning Refrigerant
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Particulate Matter, Volatile Organic Compounds and NOx}
